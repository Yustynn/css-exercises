Oh no! The three boxes are too close to each other! Lets' give them some clearer separation

# TASKS
1. Give the `body` tag a `background-image` of SUTD's logo. Use the `url(http://something)` value.
  - here's a nice big image: http://www.beanstack.sg/assets/work/logos/sutd_logo-b867c5ecdf856afc5d1dc6afea203bc6.png
2. Give all elements with the `box` class a `height` and `width` of `100px`
3. Make `#box-one`'s background color `orange`
4. Make `#box-two`'s background color `#e67e22`
5. Make `#box-three`'s background color `rgba(230, 126, 34, 0.6)`
