Oh no! The three boxes are too close to each other! Lets' give them some clearer separation

# TASKS
1. Give all the `.box` elements a `margin` of `10px`
2. Give `#box-one`
  - A `border` that's `black`
  - A `border-width` of `5px`
  - A `border-style` of `solid`
  - PRO TIP: You can combine all three in the following single declaration - `border: 5px solid black`
3. Give `#box-two` a `padding-right` and `padding-left` of `30px`. What happens to the text?
3. Give `#box-three` a `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` of `100px`. What happens to the text?
