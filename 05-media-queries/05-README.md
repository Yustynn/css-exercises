Let's make our work in exercise #1 response, in case our users are on a phone instead of a laptop! We've already written the exercise 1 code in for you.

# TASKS
When the media is below 481px,
1. Change all <h1> tags' `font-size` to `30px`
2. Change the `#h1` element's `text-align` to `right`
3. Change all <p> tags' `background-color` to `darkseagreen` (yes, that's a thing) and `color` to `gray`
